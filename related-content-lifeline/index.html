    <p>In the days before they buried her, no one knew how not to come undone. Her roommate dropped out of school. Her father kept abruptly needing to leave the room. And her mother, who looked so much like her already, started wearing her daughter&#39;s clothes. In the news and on campus, Rachael Fiege became known as the IU freshman who died at her first college party. The one who never even made it to her first class.</p>

    <p>When the student body presidents from six Indiana universities approached state Sen. Jim Merritt, R-31st District in the fall of 2011, he wasn&#39;t sure he could help them.</p>

    <p>The students, one of whom represented IU, asked Merritt to author a bill that would give immunity to underage youth under the influence of alcohol when they call to receive medical help for a friend.</p>

    <p>Dozens of college students filed into the Indiana Memorial Union Whittenberger Auditorium Friday to learn from the story of Rachael Fiege.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Rachael&#39;s First Week&#8221; is a program designed to help high school seniors and college freshmen safely transition from high school to college, according to the program&#39;s website.</p>

    <p>Angi Fiege, Rachaelâ€™s mom, formed the program in an effort to prevent tragedy striking another family after tragedy struck her own.</p>
